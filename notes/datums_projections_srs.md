# Geographic Coordinate System (GCS)

A GCS is formed by 3 pieces of information: Datum, Coordinate System, and Projection.

## Datum

Datum defines the reference frame (origin) used to measure locations on Earth.  The shape of the Earth is a factor
when determining the reference frame.  Earth is commonly depicted as either a Sphere or Ellipsoid (Spheroid).  Using 
a Sphere makes calculations easier but is not the best appoximation because of flattening at the poles.

> The assumption that the earth is a sphere is possible for small-scale maps (smaller than 1:5,000,000). 
> At this scale, the differencebetween a sphere and a spheroid is not detectable on a map. 
> However, to maintain accuracy for larger-scale maps (scales of 1:1,000,000 or larger), 
> a spheroid is necessary to represent the shape of the earth. Between those scales, choosing to use a 
> sphere or spheroid will depend on the map's purpose and the accuracy of the data. [source](http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.2/index.cfm?TopicName=Spheroids_and_spheres)
